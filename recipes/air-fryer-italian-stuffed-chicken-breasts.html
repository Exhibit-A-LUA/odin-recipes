  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Stuffed chicken, but let's make it Italian! Cream cheese, pesto, and Parmesan cheese are combined and packed into chicken breast pockets, giving a wonderfully juicy result. Air frying them makes this quick, easy, and mess-free, but they're just as good baked in the oven. Bring a little bit of Italy to your table tonight!</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>450 (g) (2) chicken breasts</li>
    <li>110 (g) (110 ml) cream cheese</li>
    <li>2 tbsp green pesto</li>
    <li>2 tbsp Parmesan cheese, finely grated</li>
    <li>½ tsp avocado oil</li>
    <li>¼ tsp sea salt</li>
    <li>¼ tsp ground black pepper</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the air fryer to 350°F (180°C).</li>
    <li>Place the chicken breasts flat on a chopping board and slice a pocket into each breast horizontally.</li>
    <li>Combine the cream cheese, pesto, and Parmesan cheese.</li>
    <li>Spoon equal portions of the cheese mixture into the pockets of the chicken breasts.</li>
    <li>Fold the top of the chicken breast over the filling and secure it with a toothpick.</li>
    <li>Drizzle the avocado oil over the chicken breasts and rub it in.</li>
    <li>Season on both sides with sea salt and ground black pepper.</li>
    <li>Place the stuffed chicken breasts in the preheated air fryer and cook for 18-20 minutes until golden and cooked through.</li>

  </ol>
  <h2>Tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To boost the flavour further, sprinkle some Italian seasoning on the outside of the chicken breasts after rubbing them with oil.</li>
    <li>Smaller chicken breasts will take 16-18 minutes to cook, large ones 20 minutes or more.</li>
    <li>Try red pesto or olive tapenade instead of traditional green pesto!</li>
