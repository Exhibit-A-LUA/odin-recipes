  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>ou won't believe that cheese is one of the main ingredients in these gluten-free treats — we had to try more than one to believe it! They taste like the real thing, but they're delightfully keto!</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>170 g (350 ml) mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
    <li>2 tbsp cream cheese</li>
    <li>240 ml (110 g) almond flour</li>
    <li>3 tbsp whey protein isolate (unflavoured)</li>
    <li>60 ml (55 g) erythritol</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1 tsp white wine vinegar</li>
    <li>½ tsp baking soda</li>
    <li>475 ml oil for frying, or as much as you need to cover the bites in oil</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Melt the mozzarella and cream cheese in a non-stick pan over medium heat or in a bowl in the microwave.</li>
    <li>Stir until thoroughly combined.</li>
    <li>Add the almond flour, whey protein isolate, erythritol, egg, white wine vinegar, and baking soda.</li>
    <li>Form a smooth dough by kneading it with your hands or using an electric mixer with dough hooks.</li>
    <li>Divide the dough into balls with your fingers or a small cookie scoop; they should be about 1-1/2 inches (4 cm) in diameter.</li>
    <li>Heat the oil in a deep pan to 325°F (160°C).</li>
    <li>Fry the churros in batches for 1-1/2 to 2 minutes until golden, rolling them around gently as they fry.</li>
    <li>Remove them with a slotted spoon and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to absorb the excess oil.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>There is one churro bite per serving.</li>
    <li>These are best served on the same day they're made.</li>
    <li>You can bake them instead. Grease a mini muffin tin and fill each muffin hole with a churro bite. Bake in the oven at 400°F (200°C) until golden, for about 20 minutes. Roll the bites in the cinnamon-erythritol mixture while warm.</li>
  </ul>
