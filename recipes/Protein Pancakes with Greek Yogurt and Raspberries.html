  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>These gluten-free breakfast pancakes are high in protein, thanks to cottage cheese. A dollop of Greek yogurt on top not only ups the protein even more, it adds that irresistible creamy satisfaction. Give the dish a final flourish with fresh raspberries or whichever berries you prefer. What a delicious way to start the day!</p>

  <h2>Storing and reheating</h2>

    <li>To store them stacked on top of each other, place a piece of parchment paper between each pancake so they don't stick together.</li>

  </ul>
