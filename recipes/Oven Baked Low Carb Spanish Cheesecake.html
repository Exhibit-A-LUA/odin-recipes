  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Its simplicity and creaminess have captivated us, so we just had to create a low Carbs version. Don't be surprised if this low Carbs cheesecake becomes a new family favourite.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>300 ml heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>550 (g) (550 ml) cream cheese</li>
    <li>4 eggs</li>
    <li>180 ml (160 g) erythritol</li>
    <li>2½ tsp almond flour</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
    <li>Add all of the ingredients to a large bowl and mix with an electric hand mixer.</li>
    <li>Line a 10" (25 cm) spring-form pan with moistened and crumpled parchment paper to make it more malleable.</li>
    <li>Pour the mixture into the pan and bake in the lower part of the oven, for 30-35 minutes, or until the surface of the cake is nicely browned.</li>
    <li>Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for at least 2 hours before serving.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>This cheesecake increases in flavour and texture as it rests.</li>
    <li>Try to make it the day before for a perfect result.</li>
    <li>If it seems uncooked when you take it out of the oven, it is normal, it will solidify as it cools.</li>
    <li>It may also settle a little, so it is recommended not to open the oven while baking.</li>
    <li>We like to eat it without toppings, but you can serve it with a home-made berries coulis, or with a low-Carb chocolate sauce.</li>
    <li>For extra flavour you could add orange, lime or lemon zest.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Recommended cooking equipment:</h2>
