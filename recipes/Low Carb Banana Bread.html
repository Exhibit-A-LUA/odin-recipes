  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 (200 g) very ripe bananas, cut in smaller pieces</li>
    <li>6 large eggs</li>
    <li>6 tbsp butter melted</li>
    <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>700 ml (325 g) almond flour</li>
    <li>4 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
    <li>1⁄8 tsp salt</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).</li>
    <li>Add the banana, eggs, vanilla, and melted butter to a food processor or a medium-sized bowl if you are using an electric hand mixer.</li>
    <li>Mix until smooth.</li>
    <li>Add the dry ingredients and mix until well-combined.</li>
    <li>Line a loaf pan 9" x 5" (23 x 13 cm) with parchment paper and fill with the batter.</li>
    <li>Bake in the oven for 50 minutes or until you insert a knife and it comes out clean.</li>
    <li>Check the loaf halfway through.</li>
    <li>If the top is getting too brown, cover loosely with tin foil.</li>
    <li>Let cool on the rack for at least 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Cut in slices and enjoy with butter or low-Carb nut butter.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Get creative! You can add more spices to the batter like cardamom and nutmeg, or top the loaf with a few crushed nuts, seeds, or low-Carb sugar-free chocolate chips.</li>
    <li>This banana bread is only slightly sweet due to the natural sugar in the banana. If you prefer sweeter banana bread, you can add up to 1/4 cup of erythritol or low-Carb sweetener of choice.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>How to store banana bread</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Banana bread can keep for 1-2 days on the counter top, but we suggest keeping it in the fridge where it will last for up to 1 week in an airtight container.</li>
    <li>You can also slice and freeze our healthy, low-Carb banana bread for a month or more.</li>
    <li>Take out a slice and heat when you need it!</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>One is not waiting until the banana is ripe.</li>
    <li>The riper the banana, the sweeter it is.</li>
    <li>Since this bread has no sweetener, the bananas must be very ripe and spotty, almost brown.</li>
    <li>The second mistake is baking it too long.</li>
    <li>If you make it too long, the bread can come out dry.</li>
    <li>Make sure to check the bread every 5 minutes or so after the 30 min mark to see if it's done.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Aren't bananas high in carbs?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Yes, a medium-sized banana does have around 24 grams of carbs.</li>
    <li>But in this recipe, we have included high protein eggs and almond flour so that only a small amount of banana is included in each portion.</li>
