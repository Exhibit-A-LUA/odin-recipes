  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <h3>Tarragon dressing</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="Tarragon Dressing.html" target="_blank">see Tarragon Dressing Recipe</a></li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Salad</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Prep the salad as you please and arrange the veggies on a big serving plate or individual plates.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Garlic Steak Bites</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat a large frying pan on high heat.</li>
    <li>Add the ghee or butter, and once melted, add the meat and season generously with salt and ground black pepper.</li>
    <li>When the meat starts to get some colour, add the garlic and mix it around.</li>
    <li>Fry just until the meat is browned on all sides.</li>
    <li>You don't want to overcook it; then the meat will get chewy.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Serving</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Top the salad with the steak bites, garlic, and meat drippings from the pan.</li>
    <li>Drizzle the dressing on top or serve it on the side.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>What is ghee?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ghee is clarified butter meaning that the milk protein has been removed.</li>
    <li>This makes it perfect for frying on high temperatures since it won't burn as easily as butter.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Budget tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ask the butcher if they have steak bites you could buy.</li>
    <li>Some butchers will charge a lot less for steak bites even if the cut is typically more expensive since the pieces are too small to sell as a full steak.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Don't want red meat?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You could replace the meat with any meat of your preference.</li>
    <li>For example chicken, pork tenderloin, lamb or even fish or shrimps.</li>
    <li>Just make sure to adjust the cooking methods accordingly.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>For juicer steak bites</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>If you choose a less tender cut of meat like flank, you can marinate in advance to tenderize and flavour the meat.</li>
    <li>A combination of tamari, vinegar, olive oil, garlic powder, dried parsley works very nicely with this dish.</li>
  </ul>
