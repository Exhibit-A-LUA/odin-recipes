  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <h3>Garlic butter</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="Garlic Butter.html" target="_blank">see Garlic butter Recipe</a></li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Meat and veggie plate</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Let the steak and sausage come to room temperature.</li>
    <li>Preheat the grill to hot.</li>
    <li>Brush the mushrooms with half the olive oil and add a pinch of salt.</li>
    <li>Pour the rest of the oil over the tomatoes and season with salt, pepper, and oregano.</li>
    <li>Season your steak generously with salt and pepper, on all sides.</li>
    <li>Place the tomatoes (skin side down) and the mushrooms (domed side up) on the grill.</li>
    <li>Then, place the sausages and steak on the grill.</li>
    <li>Keep an eye on them all, as cooking times will depend on the heat of your grill and how close the rack is to the heat.</li>
    <li>Turn your meats as necessary throughout the next steps.</li>
    <li>When mushrooms need to be flipped, remove them and spread the garlic butter over the gill side with a knife.</li>
    <li>Return to the grill until lightly browned and wrinkled around the edges.</li>
    <li>When the steak is cooked to your liking, remove it from the grill and let it rest for a few minutes.</li>
    <li>When everything is cooked, slice the steak and divide everything between warm plates.</li>
    <li>Serve with watercress and drizzle over some olive oil and add a pinch of salt.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Oven method</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>If you are using the oven instead of the grill.</li>
    <li>Preheat to 400°F (200°C) on the broiler setting.</li>
    <li>Place the mushrooms, sausages, and tomatoes on a baking rack, over a baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Broil for about 25 minutes.</li>
    <li>After about 15 minutes flip the sausages and mushrooms.</li>
    <li>Add the garlic butter to the mushrooms and continue broiling.</li>
    <li>Heat a frying pan over high heat.</li>
    <li>Season the steak generously all over.</li>
    <li>Hold the fat-side down in the hot frying pan with tongs.</li>
    <li>Let it sizzle, brown, and release the fat, then use that to cook the steak to your liking.</li>
    <li>Remove from the pan and set aside to rest.</li>
    <li>When food is served, pour over any remaining liquids from the baking sheet.</li>
  </ol>
