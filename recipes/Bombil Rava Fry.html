  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <h3>Clean Bombay Duck fish</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Spread a paper on the board, so that it doesn't get dirty.</li>
    <li>Take a chopping board and a sharp knife.</li>
    <li>Take a fish on chopping board.</li>
    <li>Chop off Tail, Head and Fins using a sharp knife</li>
    <li>Ensure knife that is used for cleaning is sharp.</li>
    <li>Cut below the head in a diagonal manner and pull out the offal.</li>
    <li>Chop off the fins now.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Remove its scales and organs</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>With the blunt edge of knife scrape off the shells by running it along its body from tail to head.</li>
    <li>Cut along its stomach and open the fish.</li>
    <li>We will run the knife along this faint line running through its stomach.</li>
    <li>Remove the offal from inside and discard.</li>
    <li>Keep going deeper gradually so that we can open the fish completely.</li>
    <li>You can use the center bone as a reference for cutting along.</li>
    <li>Flip to other side.</li>
    <li>If it still does not look completely flat, you can go a little deeper.</li>
    <li>Do not cut too deep, we don't want to cut it into two different parts.</li>
    <li>Wash and clean the fish with water.</li>
    <li>After cleaning with water, pat dry with a kitchen napkin.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Prepare the fish</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Marinate with Turmeric Powder, Salt and Lemon Juice.</li>
    <li>Turmeric Powder has antiseptic and anti-bacterial properties.</li>
    <li>Lemon Juice and Turmeric Powder helps get rid of fish smell.</li>
    <li>Apply this mixture on fish on both sides.</li>
    <li>Keep aside for 10 mins.</li>
    <li>Bombay Duck has lot of moisture content which must be removed from the fish.</li>
    <li>We will take a chopping board.</li>
    <li>You can take any large flat object and cover with a piece of cloth.</li>
    <li>Arrange marinated fish on this cloth.</li>
    <li>Now, cover fish with another piece of cloth.</li>
    <li>Place another chopping board/flat surface object.</li>
    <li>Place a heavy object/load on this board.</li>
    <li>Leave the fish for 30 mins.</li>
    <li>For second marination, grind chilies, ginger and garlic together.</li>
    <li>Grind into a thick and coarse paste with 1-2 tsp water.</li>
    <li>The coarse paste is ready. Keep it aside.</li>
    <li>After removing the excess moisture and the fish has become firm.</li>
    <li>Take a large plate, and put green masala paste.</li>
    <li>Apply this masala on all the fish. Fish is ready now.</li>
    <li>We will refrigerate for 10 mins before frying.</li>
    <li>This will help in making fish firm and it becomes easy to handle while frying.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h3>Cook the fish</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Now, we will make a dry batter for frying the fish.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, put Semolina, Rice flour and Malvani Masala.</li>
    <li>If you don't have this Masala, you can use 3 tbsp Kashmiri red Chili Powder+ 1 tbsp Garam Masala Powder instead.</li>
    <li>Add Salt to taste and mix well.</li>
    <li>We have used more Semolina/Rava in the batter as this is Rava fry.</li>
    <li>If you chose, you can skip Rava completely and make a batter of rice flour, Malvani masala and salt.</li>
    <li>You can store this dry batter in your refrigerator and use it when required for fish fry.</li>
    <li>Take some quantity of batter in a plate and reserve remaining.</li>
    <li>Remove fish from refrigerator and coat it with this batter.</li>
    <li>Apply the coating nicely.</li>
    <li>Put a pan on heat. Let's start frying the fish now.</li>
    <li>We have heated 2-3 tbsp Cooking Oil in a Pan.</li>
    <li>As the Oil becomes hot, reduce heat and put a batter-coated fish on the pan and fry on low-medium heat.</li>
    <li>For a good fish fry, it is important that you heat the Oil and tawa perfectly and then fry fish on low-medium heat.</li>
    <li>If Oil temperature is too low, fish will stick to the pan and while changing its side its skin may come off.</li>
    <li>Such fried fish does not look appetizing.</li>
    <li>Cook the underside for 3 mins, then change sides.</li>
    <li>The underside is well cooked and looks crisp fried.</li>
    <li>Spread the Oil all around the tawa.</li>
    <li>Cook for 3 more mins from other side.</li>
    <li>Remove from pan after 3 mins.</li>
    <li>Add some more Oil and fry remaining fish.</li>
  </ol>
