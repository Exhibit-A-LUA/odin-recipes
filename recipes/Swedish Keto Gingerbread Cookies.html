  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>The smell of baking gingerbread will fill your kitchen with a Christmas spirit like few other recipes. Our version of keto gingerbread cookies is based on a traditional Swedish recipe that we ketofied for you. They are equally as fun to bake as they are delicious to eat. God Jul!</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>120 ml water</li>
    <li>2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>2 tsp ground ginger</li>
    <li>2 tsp ground cloves</li>
    <li>110 (g) butter</li>
    <li>300 ml (140 g) almond flour</li>
    <li>180 ml (160 g) erythritol</li>
    <li>120 ml (50 g) coconut flour</li>
    <li>1 tbsp ground psyllium husk powder</li>
    <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
    <li>1 egg white</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Mix the water and spices in a small saucepan.</li>
    <li>Bring to a boil.</li>
    <li>Remove from heat and add the butter.</li>
    <li>Stir until melted.</li>
    <li>The cinnamon will make the consistency a bit slimy.</li>
    <li>Mix all of the dry ingredients in a separate bowl.</li>
    <li>Add the spice mixture and egg white.</li>
    <li>Mix thoroughly and shape the dough into a ball.</li>
    <li>Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight to let the flavours mature.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 300째F (150째C).</li>
    <li>Cut the dough in half and use a rolling pin to flatten the dough.</li>
    <li>Placing the dough between two pieces of parchment paper is the easiest.</li>
    <li>When flattened, the dough should be about 1/8 inch (3 mm) thick.</li>
    <li>Using cookie cutters, cut the gingerbread cookies into shapes.</li>
    <li>Use a spatula to carefully move them to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Bake the cookies for 7-9 minutes or until lightly browned.</li>
    <li>Lower the heat to 200째F (100째C) and continue to bake them for about 30 minutes or until crisp depending on the size and thickness of the cookies.</li>
    <li>Let the cookies cool completely on a cooling rack before serving or decorating them.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>For a more traditional Swedish experience, we suggest serving these gingerbread cookies with a schmear of butter and some crumbled blue cheese.</li>
    <li>It may sound like an odd combination, but it is a delicious treat and a sophisticated flavour combination for holiday hors d'oeuvre.</li>
