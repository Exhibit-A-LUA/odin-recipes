  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Our high-protein Dutch baby is whipped up in a blender and takes less than 15 minutes to bake, making it simple enough for a hectic weekday morning. It is topped with smoked ham and shredded cheddar straight from the oven. Enjoy it hot or cold.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>160 ml heavy whipping cream, room temperature</li>
    <li>8 large eggs, room temperature</li>
    <li>55 (g) (55 ml) cream cheese, softened</li>
    <li>3 tbsp unflavoured whey protein isolate (unflavoured)</li>
    <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
    <li>1 tsp garlic powder (optional)</li>
    <li>1 tsp onion powder (optional)</li>
    <li>¼ tsp salt</li>
    <li>230 (g) smoked deli ham, chopped</li>
    <li>180 ml (85 g) cheddar cheese shredded</li>
    <li>1 tsp unsalted butter, for the pan</li>
    <li>1 tsp dried chives or fresh chives (optional)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
    <li>Place the cream, eggs, cream cheese, whey protein isolate, baking powder, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt in a blender and blend until smooth and creamy.</li>
    <li>Blend for at least a minute to aerate the mixture.</li>
    <li>Set aside.</li>
    <li>Put the butter in a 10" (25 cm) oven-proof skillet and place the skillet in the oven.</li>
    <li>When the butter begins to sizzle, remove the pan from the oven and pour the batter into the centre of the hot skillet.</li>
    <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes or until the Dutch baby is puffy and browned.</li>
    <li>The centre should be just set.</li>
    <li>The Dutch baby is likely to rise in a lopsided fashion and will deflate somewhat as it cools.</li>
    <li>As soon as the Dutch baby is removed from the oven, top with the chopped ham and shredded cheddar cheese.</li>
    <li>Serve hot or cold.</li>
    <li>Garnish with fresh herbs such as chives, thyme, or parsley.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>When warm, the texture of this dish is light, when cold it is more dense, like a custard.</li>
    <li>If you aren’t familiar with a Dutch Baby, be prepared for it to bake up puffy and lopsided, and then to deflate just out of the oven.</li>
    <li>For best results, be sure to let all ingredients come to room temperature before placing them in the blender.</li>
  </ul>
