  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>I use the cream which comes on top of full cream milk after boiling and chilling in the fridge overnight. You can easily double the quantity for a larger tin and bake for about 10-15 minutes extra. If you don't have an egg beater you can still bake this cake. I have used the Indian measuring cup of 200 ml . You can use the American measuring cup for this too... just increase the baking powder to 1 teaspoon and use large eggs.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup chilled  cream</li>
    <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup heapful flour (1 level  cup + one fourth level cup to be very precise, if the concept of heapful is not clear to you)</li>
    <li>3/4 tsp baking powder</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp baking soda</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Gently beat the cream and sugar just until dissolved.</li>
    <li>Do not over-beat as sometimes the cream turns in to butter.</li>
    <li>That's one reason I have asked you all to take chilled cream.</li>
    <li>Another option is to just stir the two together and keep in the fridge for a little while so that they get dissolved.</li>
    <li>Take it out after half an hour or so, let it come to room temperature say in ten minutes and take the following steps.</li>
    <li>Throw in the two eggs and beat with a whisk. sift the flour with the baking powder and soda.</li>
    <li>Throw in the flour. I literally did that.</li>
    <li>Ideally one should add one spoon at a time and gently fold in, but I just threw in the whole lot of the flour and beat gently with the whisk.</li>
    <li>Pour the batter into a small tin and place in the centre of a preheated oven at 180 degree Celsius.</li>
    <li>Bake for 35 minutes or till a toothpick inserted comes out clean...maybe  five minute more.</li>
    <li>Let the cake come to room temperature before taking it out of the tin.</li>
  </ol>
