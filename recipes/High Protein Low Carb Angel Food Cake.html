  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Angel food cake is light and flavourful because of the whipped egg whites. Enjoy it plain or top it with berries, fresh cream, lemon curd, or our milk chocolate sauce. You can even use leftover slices to make French toast.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <h3>The Cake</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>160 ml (75 g) almond flour</li>
    <li>240 ml (100 g) whey protein isolate (unflavoured)</li>
    <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
    <li>¼ tsp salt</li>
    <li>12 large egg whites</li>
    <li>1 tsp cream of tartar or lemon juice</li>
    <li>240 ml (130 g) powdered erythritol</li>
    <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Serving</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>240 ml (130 g) fresh raspberries</li>
    <li>2 tbsp powdered erythritol (optional)</li>
    <li>240 ml heavy whipping cream</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 325°F (160°C).</li>
    <li>Prepare an angel food cake pan (16 cup/4 litres) or a deep sheet pan by lining it with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Do not grease the pan.</li>
    <li>Use a sifter or wire sieve to sift the almond flour, whey protein isolate, baking powder, and salt into a medium-sized bowl.</li>
    <li>Sift all ingredients together a second time and set aside.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, use a hand mixer or stand mixer to whip the egg whites and cream of tartar until frothy.</li>
    <li>As the whites begin to take shape, sprinkle in the sweetener while continuing to beat the egg whites.</li>
    <li>After the sweetener is added, pour in the vanilla extract.</li>
    <li>Whip until stiff peaks form.</li>
    <li>Add about one-third of the sifted ingredients to the egg whites and gently fold the dry ingredients into the egg whites.</li>
    <li>Repeat until all of the dry ingredients are added.</li>
    <li>Fold the ingredients carefully so that the egg whites do not deflate.</li>
    <li>Place the batter into the prepared pan and gently smooth the top until even.</li>
    <li>Bake for 35-40 minutes or until the top is browned and springy to the touch.</li>
    <li>Let cool 15-20 minutes before inverting the cake from the pan.</li>
    <li>The cake may deflate slightly as it cools.</li>
    <li>A serrated knife will make cutting the cake easier.</li>
    <li>Mash the raspberries with a fork in a bowl.</li>
    <li>Add the sweetener depending on how sweet the raspberries are.</li>
    <li>Serve the angel food cake with whipping cream and raspberry purée.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Tips for whipping egg whites</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Use a clean, dry bowl with no oil residue and no moisture.</li>
    <li>Let the egg whites warm to room temperature.</li>
    <li>Fresh egg whites tend to whip more easily than buying egg whites in a carton.</li>
    <li>Begin by whipping the whites on low speed.</li>
    <li>Gradually increase the speed of the beater to allow more air into the whites.</li>
    <li>item</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Don't grease the pan!</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The egg whites in this recipe need to be able to climb the sides of the cake pan.</li>
    <li>If you oil the sides, the cake won't rise properly.</li>
    <li>Use parchment paper as directed in the recipe to keep the cake from sticking to the pan.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Using a different pan</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>If you don't have an angel food pan, you can bake this like a sheet cake in a 9 by 13 inch (33 by 23 cm) pan.</li>
    <li>You may need to reduce the baking time by 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Test for done-ness by lightly touching the middle of the cake.</li>
    <li>If the cake springs back to light touch, it is done.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Make a trifle</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>If you have any difficulty with the cake sticking to the pan or if the cake deflates a bit, cut it into cubes and layer the cake with fresh berries, whipped cream, or lemon curd to make a trifle.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Storing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Store the cake at room temperature for up to two days or refrigerate in an airtight container for up to five days.</li>
  </ul>
