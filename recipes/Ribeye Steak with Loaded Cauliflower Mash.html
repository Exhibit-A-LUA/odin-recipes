  </ul>
  <h3>Rib-eye Steaks</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Generously season both sides of the steaks with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Heat a large frying pan over high heat.</li>
    <li>When hot, add the ghee or oil.</li>
    <li>Place the steaks in the pan, and press down with a spatula to ensure that contact is made with the surface of the pan.</li>
    <li>After a couple of minutes, add the butter and crushed garlic.</li>
    <li>Spoon the garlic butter over the steaks frequently, while searing.</li>
    <li>Sear for 4-5 minutes per side (depending on the desired done-ness), until sides are browned.</li>
    <li>To cook the beef to medium-rare, cook until the internal temperature reaches 130°F or 55°C.</li>
    <li>Transfer the steaks from the pan to a plate or cutting board.</li>
    <li>Cover with aluminium foil and rest for about 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    <li>Garnish the loaded cauliflower with sour cream and scallions, and serve on the side with the steaks.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To raise steaks to room temperature, rest on the counter for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Rib-eye cook time: Thinner cuts will require less cook time than thicker cuts.</li>
    <li>And grass-fed beef usually cooks more quickly than grain-fed beef so make sure that you don't overcook them.</li>
    <li>It is best to use ghee or refined coconut oil when frying the steaks because they tolerate high heat.</li>
    <li>You could also use butter, but as it contains some milk protein, it will burn easily and smoke.</li>
    <li>This is why we add the butter towards the end of the searing.</li>
    <li>If you don't care for red meat you can substitute the steak with chicken thighs.</li>
    <li>Just make sure to cook them all the way through.</li>
    <li>You can also replace the pork bacon with turkey bacon, or omit the bacon altogether.</li>
    <li>For the best result, choose rib-eye steaks of good quality, preferably grass-fed beef, that have nice, even marbling.</li>
    <li>Thicker cuts are also easier to cook to your preferred done-ness.</li>
