  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>We love breakfast bowls because they're cozy, loaded with protein, and full of flavour! This protein-rich keto breakfast bowl is all of those things. Creamy eggs topped with crispy bacon, sour cream, cheddar cheese, and chives. Customize to your heart's desire.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>110 g bacon</li>
    <li>4 tbsp sour cream</li>
    <li>6 large eggs</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper</li>
    <li>4 tbsp shredded cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>2 tbsp finely chopped fresh chives</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Cut the bacon into small pieces and fry it in a skillet over medium-high heat until crisp.</li>
    <li>Remove the bacon from the skillet and set aside, leaving the bacon fat.</li>
    <li>Lower the heat and add half the sour cream to the skillet.</li>
    <li>When melted, add the scrambled eggs and stir continuously with a spatula until your preferred consistency is reached.</li>
    <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    <li>Divide the scrambled eggs into serving bowls and top with cheese, bacon, remaining sour cream, chives, and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
    <li>Enjoy right away with a spoon.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Serve the loaded eggs with some crunchy veggies like bell pepper, cucumber, or celery stalks.</li>
    <li>Use them to scoop up the eggs as a dip.</li>
    <li>It will add some extra carbs, but it will also add more vitamins and fibre to keep you satisfied for longer.</li>
    <li>If you don't care for bacon, you could replace it with smoked salmon or deli turkey.</li>
    <li>Chives can be substituted with spring onion.</li>
  </ul>
