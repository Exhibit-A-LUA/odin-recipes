  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>You will love these sugar-free blueberry cream cheese muffins that take only minutes to whip up. We suggest enjoying them as a dessert, not as breakfast. It's best to start your day with a savoury, higher protein dish and enjoy these tasty low Carb muffins as a healthy treat instead.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>110 (g) unsalted butter</li>
    <li>110 (g) (110 ml) cream cheese</li>
    <li>4 large eggs</li>
    <li>240 ml (110 g) almond flour</li>
    <li>80 ml (32 g) coconut flour</li>
    <li>1 tbsp ground psyllium husk powder</li>
    <li>1½ tsp baking powder</li>
    <li>¼ tsp salt</li>
    <li>160 ml (140 g) erythritol</li>
    <li>80 ml sour cream</li>
    <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 tsp lemon juice</li>
    <li>80 ml (50 g) fresh blueberries</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
    <li>Prepare a standard muffin tin by greasing it well or lining it with parchment paper liners.</li>
    <li>Place the butter, cream cheese, and eggs on the counter and bring to room temperature.</li>
    <li>Mix the almond flour, coconut flour, psyllium husk powder, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Use a hand mixer or stand mixer to cream together the butter, cream cheese, and erythritol until smooth.</li>
    <li>The butter should be lighter in colour and the erythritol should be dissolved.</li>
    <li>Continue using the mixer to whip in the eggs one at a time.</li>
    <li>Scrape down the sides of the bowl between adding each egg.</li>
    <li>Use a rubber spatula to fold in the sour cream.</li>
    <li>Add the dry ingredients and mix until a thick batter forms.</li>
    <li>Add the vanilla extract and lemon juice. Stir to combine.</li>
    <li>Gently fold in the blueberries.</li>
    <li>Divide the thick batter evenly among the muffin cups.</li>
    <li>Bake for 30 minutes or until golden and the tops bounce back to a light touch.</li>
    <li>Cool for at least 30 minutes before serving.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>For pretty muffins, reserve some berries to press into the top of each muffin just before baking.</li>
    <li>For that signature domed muffin top, don’t heat the butter or cream cheese before mixing.</li>
    <li>They should be at room temperature, which means they should be soft to the touch, leaving no more than a finger indent when poked.</li>
    <li>They should not be squishy or melted.</li>
    <li>Combine the dry ingredients thoroughly before adding them to the cream cheese mixture.</li>
    <li>This helps ensure that the dry ingredients don't clump, and will mix well into the batter.</li>
    <li>The psyllium fibre powder in this recipe is what gives it the texture similar to traditional bakery muffins.</li>
    <li>This batter will be thick unlike traditional muffin batter made with flour.</li>
    <li>Don't try to thin the batter.</li>
    <li>Use a rubber spatula, large spoon, or large cookie scoop to fill the muffin tins.</li>
    <li>While it may be hard to wait, these muffins are best after they've cooled a bit.</li>
    <li>Store leftovers at room temperature for up to three days or refrigerate for up to one week.</li>
    <li>These muffins freeze beautifully for portion control and future treats.</li>
    <li>Just wrap well and use a freezer-safe container.</li>
    <li>Thaw at room temperature or in the refrigerator.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Looking for other healthy sugar-free muffin recipes?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Think of this batter as a blank canvas!</li>
    <li>Try adding different flavours such as chopped, low Carb friendly chocolates, or use another low Carb berry, like raspberries or blackberries.</li>
    <li>If using frozen fruit, but sure to thaw and drain the fruit so you don't introduce more moisture into the batter.</li>
    <li>This muffin is also tasty with spices instead of fruit – cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and fall flavours such as apple pie spice or pumpkin pie spice.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Gluten-free apple peanut butter muffin recipe</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>For a delicious apple peanut butter muffin, mix in the following ingredients just before baking.</li>
    <li>⅓ cup salted peanut butter</li>
    <li>¼ cup finely chopped apples (about ¼ of a small apple)</li>
    <li>Adding the peanut butter at the end will increase the peanut butter flavour.</li>
    <li>Using chunky peanut butter will also add some texture to the muffin just as the chopped apple will.</li>
    <li>Remember that adding these ingredients increases the net Carb count from 2 grams per muffin to 3 grams per muffin.</li>
  </ul>
