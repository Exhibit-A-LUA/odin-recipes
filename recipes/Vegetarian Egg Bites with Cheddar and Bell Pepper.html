  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>These soft and creamy vegetarian egg bites are what you might expect if scrambled eggs and a soufflé were to meet and mingle. They lend themselves beautifully to countless other fillings, which means you won't get bored! The prep is super easy and quick, and the 1-hour cooking time is essential for a soft, custardy finish. These are great to make ahead for on-the-go keto breakfasts!</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>16 large eggs</li>
    <li>350 ml whole milk</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    <li>½ tsp ground black pepper</li>
    <li>140 g (290 ml) cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
    <li>55 g (85 ml) red bell peppers, finely diced</li>
    <li>55 g (85 ml) green bell peppers, finely diced</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C) and line a 13" × 9" (33 x 23 cm) baking dish with parchment paper — the paper should come up the sides of the dish.</li>
    <li>Place the dish in a deep roasting tin (large enough to comfortably fit the dish you're using for the egg bites).</li>
    <li>Add hot tap water (not boiling) to the roasting tin until it reaches about 1-inch (2.5 cm) up the outer sides of the baking dish.</li>
    <li>Crack the eggs into a large bowl and add the whole milk, salt, and pepper.</li>
    <li>Mix with an immersion blender until smooth.</li>
    <li>If using a hand whisk, pour the egg mixture through a sieve after whisking to remove any remaining lumps or egg shells.</li>
    <li>Pour the egg mixture into the baking dish lined with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle with the bell pepper and shredded cheddar cheese.</li>
    <li>Cover tightly with aluminium foil and bake for 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Let the egg bites cool slightly, then lift them out of the dish by holding the sides of the parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Cut into 24 squares (if making 6 servings), which is 4 egg bites per serving.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Bake them in a muffin tin for individual servings.</li>
    <li>Brush muffin tin cups with a little bit of melted butter and proceed with the recipe.</li>
    <li>Bake for 35-40 minutes.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Storage</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>These egg bites stay fresh for up to 5 days in the fridge in an air-tight container.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Reheating</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>These are great cold, but if you prefer a warm breakfast, reheat in the microwave for 30 seconds.</li>
  </ul>
