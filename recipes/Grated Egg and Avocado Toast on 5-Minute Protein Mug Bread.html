  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>When a recipe goes viral, you can be pretty sure it'll be amazing. So we had to try the grated egg on toast craze, and we can confirm that it's worth the hype! We gave it a keto spin and served it with creamy avocado on our gluten-free, toasted 5-minute protein mug bread. It's fluffy to eat and oh, so pretty! We challenge you to eat it without licking your lips!</p>

  <h2>Instructions for baking in the oven</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>If you're making more than one mug bread, you might find it easier to use the oven method.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C), and grease a 4.5-inch (10 cm) wide, oven-proof mug.</li>
    <li>You can also use large cupcake liners, in which case there's no need to grease them.</li>
    <li>Instead, add the butter (melted) to the batter.</li>
    <li>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together all dry ingredients.</li>
    <li>Add the melted butter, egg and cream cheese, whisking until smooth.</li>
    <li>Make sure there are no lumps.</li>
    <li>Pour the batter into the prepared mug(s) or cupcake liner(s).</li>
    <li>Bake for 10-15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Insert a toothpick or sharp knife into the middle of the bread.</li>
    <li>If the toothpick comes out clean, it's done.</li>
    <li>Let cool and remove the bread from the mug(s) or cupcake liner(s).</li>
    <li>Slice in half and toast for the best texture and taste.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Prepare ahead</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>These are best enjoyed fresh.</li>
    <li>To cut down on prep time, make your own dry baking mix.</li>
    <li>itSimply combine 10 tablespoons (150 ml) almond flour, 10 tablespoons (150 ml) whey protein isolate, 1 teaspoon salt, and 5 teaspoons baking powder, and store in an air-tight container.em</li>
    <li>This dry mix will make 10 servings.</li>
    <li>Use 2 generous tablespoons for each piece of bread, and just whisk in the egg and cream cheese to make the batter.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Storing the bread</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Another time-saver: prepare several servings of batter at once.</li>
    <li>Keep the raw batter in the refrigerator for 2-3 days, or freeze in individual portions.</li>
    <li>It will thaw in a few minutes at room temperature.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Flavouring</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Spice it up! Season the bread with herbs or spices, like ground fennel and cumin.</li>
    <li>It's also lovely with poppy, chia, hemp, or sesame seeds.</li>
    <li>Use about 1⁄2 teaspoon of seasoning for each piece.</li>
  </ul>
