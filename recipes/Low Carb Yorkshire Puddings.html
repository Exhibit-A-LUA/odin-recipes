  <h1>Low Carb Yorkshire Puddings</h1>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Yorkshire puddings are an integral part of a British Sunday lunch, served with a nice roast and at least two veg. In America, they're more commonly known as popovers, but purists would argue that they're nothing alike. Either way, we're happy to have found a solid low carb alternative that is gluten free too! These delicious, fluffy gravy soakers bring the "ooh" factor to the table. They're impressive to serve, but they should be the last dish to come out — they deflate quickly!</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 tsp avocado oil, or another oil with a high smoke point</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>a pinch of salt</li>
    <li>60 ml heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>2 tbsp arrowroot powder</li>
    <li>1 tbsp room temperature water</li>
    <li>a pinch of ground black pepper</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
    <li>In a standard 12-cup muffin tin, divide the oil between the cups (2 cups per serving) and swirl the tin around to coat.</li>
    <li>Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl and add the salt.</li>
    <li>Beat with an electric mixer until light yellow, frothy, and voluminous.</li>
    <li>Add the heavy whipping cream, arrowroot powder, water, and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
    <li>Mix to combine.</li>
    <li>When the oven has reached the required temperature, place the oiled muffin tin in the oven for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>When the oil is hot (it may smoke a little — that's ok!)</li>
    <li>Remove the muffin tin and immediately pour the batter into the cups, filling them halfway.</li>
    <li>Quickly return them to the oven and bake for 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Do not open the oven during baking!</li>
    <li>When the Yorkshire puddings have risen and turned golden brown, remove the muffin tin from the oven and serve immediately with your Sunday (or holiday) roast and gravy.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>There are two Yorkshire puddings per serving.</li>
    <li>So for 4 servings you would fill 8 muffin cups, for 6 servings 12, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>There are a few important things to note when making Yorkshire puddings, whether low carb or regular:</li>
    <li>For best results, the ingredients should be at room temperature.</li>
    <li>The eggs really do need to be beaten until fluffy and voluminous.</li>
    <li>As there is no baking powder in this recipe, the airy eggs give the puddings their rise.</li>
    <li>It is important that the oil is heated in the muffin tin before the batter is added.</li>
    <li>Again, the shock of the heat when the batter hits the pan will help it rise.</li>
    <li>Return it to the oven immediately after pouring in the batter.</li>
    <li>Do not open the oven to check on the Yorkshire puddings. The cold air will stop the rise.</li>
  </ul>
