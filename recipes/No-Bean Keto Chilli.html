  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Say bye-bye to beans. This keto no-bean chilli, or Texas chilli, keeps all of the classic chilli flavours and keeps your carbs in check.

  <h2>How to cook keto Instant Pot chilli</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Follow steps one to three, using the InstaPot to brown the spices and meat.</li>
    <li>Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, jalapeños, and broth to the pot.</li>
    <li>Cover and cook on high pressure for 10 minutes and then natural release.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>How to make chilli in a crock pot</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Follow steps one to three.</li>
    <li>Add the browned meat, tomatoes, tomato paste, jalapeños, and broth to the slow cooker.</li>
    <li>Cover with lid and cook on low heat for five to six hours.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Should you drain the fat from the ground beef?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Whether or not to drain the fat after cooking the ground beef is a matter of personal preference.</li>
    <li>It also depends on the type of beef you use and the percent fat content.</li>
    <li>We prefer not to drain the fat to make the chilli richer.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Delicious substitutions for ground beef</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Our hearty chilli is equally delicious when made with ground pork, ground turkey, or venison.</li>
    <li>In fact, using small chunks of pork, steak, or venison will help to change the texture and can resemble the mouthfeel that beans often provide.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Are chilli beans keto friendly?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Most types of beans such as red kidney beans, black beans, and pinto beans should be avoided on a standard ketogenic diet due to their high carbohydrate content.</li>
    <li>Most cooked beans contain about 12 grams of net carbs per 3 oz. (90 grams).</li>
    <li>There are some exceptions such as green beans and black soybeans that only contain about 2 grams of net carbs per 3 oz. (90 grams).</li>
    <li>If you tolerate more carbs, feel free to add any beans of your choice.</li>
    <li>Other potential substitutes for beans might include chopped zucchini or mushrooms, both of which provide additional texture with a very subtle flavour</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What to serve chilli with?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>This dish tastes great with fresh cilantro and lime.</li>
    <li>Using full-fat crème fraiche instead of sour cream is even tastier.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>How to store chilli?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We're guessing you won't have any leftovers, but if you do, chilli is one of those dishes that tastes even better a day or two after it's made.</li>
    <li>If you do find yourself with leftovers, it will keep for three to four days.</li>
    <li>You can also try making a chilli dog using our hot dog buns that have only 1 gram of net carbs per serving.</li>
  </ul>
