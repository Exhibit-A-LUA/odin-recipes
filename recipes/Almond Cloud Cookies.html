  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>These gorgeous little treats were inspired by the popular cookies known as macaroons, but these are much healthier! Gluten-free, low Carbs, and ever so delicious, they certainly live up to their name.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>6 egg whites</li>
    <li>80 ml (45 g) powdered erythritol</li>
    <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    <li>180 ml (85 g) almond flour</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).</li>
    <li>Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Add the egg whites to a clean bowl, preferably glass or metal, and whip with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form.</li>
    <li>Gradually add the powdered erythritol and salt and whip for another minute until well combined.</li>
    <li>Gently fold in the almond flour with a large spoon or rubber spatula.</li>
    <li>Don't over-mix — keep the mixture as airy and voluminous as possible.</li>
    <li>For each cookie, scoop 1 tablespoon of the mixture onto a prepared baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Bake for about 10 minutes, or until set and lightly golden.</li>
  </ol>
