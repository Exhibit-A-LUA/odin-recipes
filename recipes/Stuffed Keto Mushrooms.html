  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Tender mushrooms are wonderful containers for a myriad of stuffings. For this recipe, use any ground meat you like! For a vegetarian version, use drained and cooked beans such as edamame. Just be mindful of your daily Carb count.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 tbsp butter, for greasing</li>
    <li>500 (g) whole, portobello mushrooms, large (preferably 2 per serving)</li>
    <li>110 (g) leeks, roughly chopped (See tip)</li>
    <li>450 (g) ground beef, or ground lamb, or ground pork</li>
    <li>50 (g) (150 ml) shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>2 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>salt and pepper</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 425째F (200째C).</li>
    <li>Grease a large, ovenproof dish with butter.</li>
    <li>Remove the stalks from the mushrooms and place the mushroom tops upside-down in the ovenproof dish.</li>
    <li>Add the mushroom stalks and chopped leeks to a food processor, and pulse until finely chopped (alternatively, you can chop all by hand).</li>
    <li>Transfer the mushroom and leek mixture to a large bowl, and add the ground meat, cheese, and Worcestershire sauce.</li>
    <li>Season with salt and pepper (omit this if you are using seasoned sausage meat).</li>
    <li>Mix together until combined.</li>
    <li>Divide the mixture evenly between the cavities of the mushrooms.</li>
    <li>Slightly flatten the tops so that each mushroom has the same depth, for equal cooking time.</li>
    <li>Any leftover mixture can be rolled into balls and cooked alongside the mushrooms.</li>
    <li>Bake on the middle rack uncovered for 15 minutes or until the internal temperature of the meat is 160째F (71째C), and the mushrooms are tender.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To prepare the leeks, rinse whole leek(s), pat dry, and then trim off the rough, green tips.</li>
    <li>Slice the remaining leek(s) into thin circles, and discard the root.</li>
    <li>Next, fill a bowl with water and add the sliced leeks.</li>
    <li>Move them around in the water to remove any remaining dirt or sand.</li>
    <li>Strain, and pat dry.</li>
  </ul>
