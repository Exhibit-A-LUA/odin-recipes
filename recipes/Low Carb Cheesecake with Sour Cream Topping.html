  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>A simple, baked cheesecake never goes out of style. We've topped ours with a classic sour cream topping, but you can also use fresh berries, our sugar-free milk chocolate sauce, a dollop of freshly whipped cream, or nothing at all! See our tips for a perfect cheesecake every single time.</p>

  <h3>Putting it all Together</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Pour the filling into the par-baked crust.</li>
    <li>Bake the cheesecake on the middle rack, for 60 to 70 minutes, until just set.</li>
    <li>It may still jiggle just a bit in the centre.</li>
    <li>Turn off the oven and let the cake cool in the oven with the door ajar for at least 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove the cheesecake from the oven, run a knife around the edge of the pan, and let the cake cool to room temperature, about 1 hour.</li>
    <li>When completely cool, cover and refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 8 hours before slicing and serving.</li>

  <h3>Serving</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Remove the outer ring from the spring-form pan and remove the parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Top the cake with sour cream topping.</li>
    <li>For a more decorative cheesecake: Whip the cream and pipe it around the sides of the cake and top with strawberries.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>First, to avoid cracks in the top of the cheesecake, let the cheesecake cool gradually by leaving it in the oven with the oven turned off, and the door slightly ajar.</li>
    <li>Running a knife around the edge of the pan as soon as the cheesecake comes out of the oven will help prevent cracks as the cake cools and contracts.</li>
    <li>You can also bake the cheesecake in a water bath, but thatâ€™s an extra step that we generally skip.</li>
    <li>Second, for the best texture, avoid over-mixing the eggs.</li>
    <li>Over-mixing the eggs results in a more fluffy texture while gently mixing the eggs yields a more dense, traditional cheesecake.</li>
    <li>Lastly, be sure to let the cheesecake cure in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours (overnight is better) for the best flavour and texture.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Storing the cheesecake</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Store in an airtight container, in the refrigerator, for up to five days.</li>
    <li>You may also freeze the cheesecake whole, or in individual slices for up to three months.</li>
    <li>Thaw in the refrigerator before serving.</li>
  </ul>
