  </ol>
  <h2>Choosing a salsa</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We recommend choosing a salsa with no added sugar that is low in carbs.</li>
    <li>Check the label, and aim for one with no more than 3 grams of net carbs per 100-gram serving.</li>
    <li>We used a mild red salsa for this recipe, but go with whatever you prefer!</li>
    <li>Green tomatillo salsas are great, as are chipotle varieties for a smoky finish.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Dress it up!</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can enjoy this with a simple salad, bell peppers or slaw on the side, or go to town with cauliflower rice, avocado, more salsa, cheese, and sour cream as in our Low Carb chicken burrito bowl with cauliflower rice</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Spice it up!</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To boost the flavour of your shredded chicken even more, feel free to sprinkle it with salt, pepper, chilli, cayenne, garlic, onion, cumin, and/or oregano before you cook it.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Serving more?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>If you're preparing more than 4 servings of this recipe, you may need to extend the cooking time to 3 or 4 hours.</li>
  </ul>
